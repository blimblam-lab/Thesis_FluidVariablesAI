# Thesis_FluidVariablesAI
Master's Thesis project: Determine fluid variables by use of AI

This repository contains the final models created in my master's thesis and the Python code with which they were made. They are separated into Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network model forlders. The LSTM folders are separated into 50 Ts and 80 Ts models, which were both retained. The folders are further separated into c_y and y/D results.
Note the .h5-files in these folders, those are the Tensorflow models which can be reloaded for later use.

The corresponding figures are bundled in the figs file.
